#  Hello World! 👋 We are SUM Lab - Delft University of Technology

## 🌍 About Us
The **Sustainable Urban Multimodal Mobility (SUM) Lab** at **TU Delft** addresses the challenges of urban mobility amid economic, demographic, and environmental shifts. With increasing density and limited transport space, ensuring sustainable and inclusive accessibility is crucial.

Emerging technologies—**ICT, electrification, automation, and the sharing economy**—are transforming mobility. Solutions like **automated vehicles, shared mobility, MaaS, and micromobility** promise safer, more efficient, and reliable transport. We advocate for a **multimodal mix**, as unimodal solutions alone are insufficient.

The SUM Lab aids stakeholders in developing **sustainable, inclusive urban transport systems** using a **digital twin approach**. By integrating mobility data with traffic and transport models, we assess the impact of new mobility solutions and design future-ready transport systems.

## 🔬 Research Areas
Our research is structured around four key domains:
- **Operations Research** (📈) – Optimizing mobility infrastructure, fleet management, and transportation networks for efficiency and sustainability.
- **Data Analytics** (📊) – Leveraging machine learning, statistical modeling, and big data to analyze urban mobility trends and improve forecasting.
- **Behavioral Analytics** (🧠) – Understanding mobility behavior, user preferences, and decision-making to enhance accessibility and equity.
- **Simulation** (🖥️) – Developing digital twin simulations to evaluate mobility scenarios and test new transport strategies in dynamic urban environments.

By integrating these approaches, we enable **impact assessment**, providing data-driven insights for policymakers, planners, and industry partners to support decision-making and long-term urban mobility planning.
